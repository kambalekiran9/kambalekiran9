PostgreSQL Totorial :
========================
**Introduction To PostgreSQL** : 

  **What is mean by Database Management system ?**

* A database is a structured collection of data. To add, access and process data stored in a computer
  database where database management system is needed and the data is stored in relational model
  therefore it's called Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).
* There are wide variety of relational databases available in the market to serve the purpose of the business
  needs from small to high end mission critical systems.

**Commercial Databases :** Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2, Informix, MySQL Enterprise Edition (Oracle),Postgres Plus Advanced Server (EnterpriseDB )
  **Open Source Databases :** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB etc

**What is mean by Open Source Databases?** 

  * Open source means that it's possible for anyone to use and modify the software. Anybody can download
  the open source software from internet and use it without paying anything and if needed the source code
  can be changed as per the business needs. Here we will concentrate more on PostgreSQL

**Origin Of PostgreSQL:**

 * The worldâ€™s most advanced open source database
 * Designed for extensibility and customization
 * ANSI (American National Standards Institute)/ISO (International organization for Standardization) compliant
   SQL support
 * PostgreSQL, originally called Postgres, was created at University of California, Berkeley by a prof. named
   Michael Stonebraker Actively developed for more than 20 years

* **Postgres (1986-1993)**

     Stonebraker started Postgres in 1986 as a followup project to its predecessor, Ingres, now owned by
     Computer Associates.

* **Postgres95 (1994-1995)**

  Postgres, developed between 1986-1994, was a project meant to break new ground in database
  concepts such as exploration of "object relational" technologies. In 1995, two Ph.D. students from
  Stonebraker's lab, Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen, replaced Postgres' POSTQUEL query language with an
  extended subset of SQL. They renamed the system to Postgres95.

* **PostgreSQL (1996-current)**

    With the start of its new life in the open source world, with many new features and enhancements,
    the database system took its current name: PostgreSQL. ("Postgres" is still used as an easy-to-pronounce
    nick name.)
